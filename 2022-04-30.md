# nornzine #1 meeting notes - brainstorm
20220430

## attendees: @jaseknighter (Jonathan), @eigen (Jordan), @zbs (Z), @karol (Karol), @Dewb (Michael), @William Hazzard, @sixolet (Naomi), @chochacho

## agenda topics: 
* purpose of the zine (not a monome ad)
* scope (e.g. teletype may be too big to include, crow could be included more easily)
* name of zine
* organization of the issue (play, create/make)
* teams (mag, bonus content, distribution, design)
* team assignments
* ephemera (cd, example code)
* proposal spreadsheet review (missing the play aspect)

## notes:

### purpose
* longer form description of the process people use to create scripts
* discord and other things are ephemeral. the zine is a more permanent record that can be easily be referenced for inspiration. like a time capsule.
* interested in getting people who haven't scripted excited to make scripts 
* there could be several levels of engagement.
  * total newcomers
  * people with a basic understanding who are struggling to actually create something they can share with the community (what's missing? motivation? something else?)
  * veteran script developers
* inspiration from expert scripters/musicians
* much of proposed contents are about making scripts. however, most of the user base doesn't want to create scripts, just want to use them to create music. we need to target both groups, but there should be a away to link the two. 
* maintain a tension between poetry (inspiration) and technique (practicality)
* articulate a set of values and aesthetics
* include articles that are contextually-specific and globally-accessable
* provide content for folks not engaged in other platforms (e.g. discord)
* important not to elevate "canonical" scripts over scripts that are less well known

### teams
* we need more people to participate (both creating content and putting the zine together)
* editors (a group of decision makers and proofreaders)
  * to prevent too much control we can make roles temporary (i.e., institute term limits) and elect people to those roles (rank-choice voting?), allowing anyone who wants to to vote
* distribution (if we do more than print on demand)
* designers (jordon will take care of high level structure but we could have other folks contribute design...identity, individual article design, etc.)
* article contributors
* marketing, communications, and advertising

### organization
* there should be threads connecting different parts of the zine together
* there should be synergy between workshops and the magazine 

### zine format
* paper magazine (Jordon is using affinity designer) with included ephemera (e.g. a cd). this could be print on demand
* digital format
* note, submissions can be created in plain text unless the article is fundamentally visual (e.g. a decision tree)

### article ideas
* interviews (like the sound+process podcast but using visual representation and including scripting concerns). zine can be a medium for sharing for folks too shy to be interviewed in a podcast.
* app review (like game review)
  * example: how to make breakbeats
* script review
    * could be a decision tree to get people to norns scripts
    * looper overview
    * granular overview
    * synthesizer overview
* there are threads on the lines forum that could turn into articles
* review the mapcorps articles for inspiration (e.g. triggering a script
* something like a disquiet junto project that gets announced ahead of publication that gets included/referenced in the magazine.  
  * alternatively, the magazine could propose a challenge that readers would respond to (musically or in scripting)
* instructions to make a paper whistle (or other instrument) and have people share the music they made with the whistle (or turn the zine into an instrument. or make music with the norns buttons.)
* concert/album reviews
* hardware projects, for example, the i2cmidi device and/or the way it was adapted into the palette case recently. Not so much hardware reviews, but spotlights on cool things people are doing with hardware
* create a crossword puzzle


### next steps
* (done) Jordan to create an organization in GitHub
* Jordan to suggest times/dates for next meeting
* (done) Jonathan to publish the notes in a GitHub
* everyone: discuss the notes in the zine chat
