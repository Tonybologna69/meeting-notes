# nornzine #1 - brainstorm #2
20220508

## attendees: @jaseknighter (Jonathan), @eigen (Jordan), @awwaid, @radioedit (Duncan), @ericmoderbacher (Eric), @Alanza (Rylee) @watercolor (Ian?), @tomw, @zbs (Z)

@tomw's mic wasn't working, @zbs arrived for the 2nd part.


## agenda topics:

- essential feature selection / scope / vision
- prepare for opening the gates to more contributors
- background thinking about aestetics / publication frequency / nb of pages


## notes:

### personal presentation / expected involvment

#### @awwaid

would provide mostly editing (proof reading?).

potentially code tutorials about fundamentals.


#### @radioedit (Duncan)

experienced in editing + writting professionally.

designer by trade.


### @ericmoderbacher (Eric)

pretty new to the discord & in this project but is motivated and just wanna be helpful.


### @jaseknighter (Jonathan)

no opinion (yet) on what his contribution might be.

good at reading/writting but bad at design.


### @watercolor

motivated as not so many similar initiatives (in synth / DIY communities)

does writting/editing for a living.

doesn't touch on the design aspect.


### @Alanza (Rylee)

interested in helping out.

did graphic design in college.

profiscient w/ Adobe suite, notably InDesign.

motivated by the idea of this zine.


## feature selection

#### purpose

@radioedit: **snapshot of the current state of the community**

-> in other words: **capture the excitment**

@radioedit: have it be **inspirational**, to motivate readers to **try new things** (scripts they never tried, coding...)

in this fashion feature newly released scripts (@zbs) as well older **unknown gems** (@radioedit).

@radioedit: more broadly, elevate lesser known stuff from the community (not only scripts, but also music...)

@ericmoderbacher + @radioedit: **don't target only the existing community** (.i.e lines) but broader appeal: **demistify** norns & other music-making aspects, **empower** readers.


#### repeatability in the structure

@jaseknighter: 1 theme / issue. smoother xp for the reader, based on expectations when seing the cover.
the theme can/must be abstract (echoes the poetry aspect).

-> don't explain everything, leave part of the interpretation to the reader.

@eigen: repeating features between issues


#### balance in the content ☯

- @jaseknighter: clear tension between **poetry** & **practicality** (technical aspects)
- @eigen: balance between **subjective** (relatable experiences, emotions) & **objective** (technical stuff)

-> would echo the 2 main sections (**PLAY/MAKE**), PLAY being more poetical/emotional and MAKE for practical/technical

BUT not a total & clear separation️

-> idea of a **"shared interview"** between a script author and musician who uses it extensively is the perfect way to link both aspects


## practical considerations

#### aestetics

it should not look too professional. leave some amateurism as it has 💖.


#### publication frequency

should not expect to make more than 2 / year
related to seasons


#### project's perenity / authoritarianism of the editorial team

would be cool to have it a perpetual project.

even if that kinda sucks, need a relatively small editorial team to converge to a coherent release.

**rotation in the editorial team** to aleviate the autoritarian aspect.

**onboarding new editors** should be one main goal.

should provide a **template of resources** to make a new issue (**open source** everything).

but for first issue, must also provide some concrete examples: **members of the editorial team must also provide content and not just guidelines**.


#### nb of pages

have a queue between issues VS accept everything as we're first & foremost digital?



## final thoughts

#### @awwaid

wants a **playground repo** for throw-away ideas & WIP articles. to "use the momentum".

-> would act like a moodboard.


#### @ericmoderbacher

reminds him of [Make:](https://makezine.com/).

"entry level" can relate to scripting BUT also mic level, using github...

-> could give ideas for articles in the PLAY section

for lots of synth nerds, norns could be intimidating.

this zine could provide small bite at a time, enough to **empower readers**.


#### @radioedit

so far asumption for it to be for the community (present or future)

-> **part of the audience should be peeps outisde of the community**

**demistifying aspect**


#### @eigen

publishing software to use?

ok w/ re-learning inDesign if that's what the majority uses, or even step down of the publishing side of things.

for design/protoyping, we could use whatever we want!

-> also have a **"tag soup"** alongside moodboard, vocab (including poetry) we wanna use in thez issue.


## next steps

* @eigen (Jordan): draft a call for contributors message
* everyone: proofread this message
* Jordan: post it on lines
* everyone: onboard new contributors without supressing all their ideas but without letting the scope / structure go off track
* Jordan: organize next meeting w/ new contributors
